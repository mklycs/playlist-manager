# Playlist Manager
This Python-based Playlist Manager automates the management of your .mp3 files by assigning a three-digit numbering system (e.g., 000. song1.mp3, 002. song2.mp3, up to a maximum of 999) to each file, provided they don't already have such a format. This numbering enables a variety of operations, including displaying playlists and songs, sorting songs, moving songs between playlists, deleting songs, and deleting playlists.

## Features
- **Automatic Numbering:** Automatically assigns a three-digit prefix to .mp3 files if they aren't already formatted in this way.
- **Display Playlists**: View all available playlists.
- **Display Songs in a Playlist:** View all songs in a specific playlist, complete with their numbering.
- **Sort Playlist:** Sort the songs in a playlist based on their numerical order.
- **Move Songs Between Playlists:** Transfer a song from one playlist to another while preserving its numbering.
- **Delete Song:** Remove a song from a playlist.
- **Delete Playlist:** Remove an entire playlist.

## Limitations
- The program supports numbering up to 999. If you exceed this limit, the program will not be able to number additional songs.
- The program assumes that the numbering format is strictly three digits followed by a dot and a space (e.g., 001. song.mp3). If files do not follow this format, they will be renumbered.
